      <description>During the first phase of the pilot, Birdwatch is limited to a small test group in the US.
Our goal is to expand Birdwatch to the global Twitter community. We want anyone to be able to participate and know that having contributors with different points of view is essential to Birdwatch helpfully addressing misinformation. We’ll draw on learnings from this initial test and, over time, scale safely.

      <title>Empowering the Twitter community to help with misleading information</title>
      <link>https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/posts/welcome-to-birdwatch/</link>

      <description>People come to Twitter to see what’s happening in the world. In addition to fun and entertainment, people on Twitter also want credible information that helps them stay informed. As the spread of misleading information continues to evolve, this has been harder to do.
People should be able to easily come away from Twitter feeling well-informed so we are continuing to explore a number of ways to help us scale and tackle the challenges of misleading information.</description>

      <title>Birdwatch Aliases</title>
      <link>https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/contributing/aliases/</link>

      <description>We want everyone to feel comfortable contributing to Birdwatch. Aliases let contributors write and rate notes without sharing their Twitter usernames.
A Birdwatch alias is a new, auto-generated display name that participants get when they join Birdwatch. Aliases are not publicly associated with contributors’ Twitter accounts, so everyone can write and rate notes privately.
Further, we believe aliases have the potential to:
 Reduce bias. By keeping focus on the content of notes rather than who’s writing them, aliases have the potential to reduce bias that people might have around specific authors.</description>

      <description>We know there are many challenges involved in building aan open, participatory system like Birdwatch — from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn’t dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors.
Throughout our development process, we’ve conducted feedback sessions with Twitter customers and subject area experts to identify critical risks to monitor and mitigate. We will be closely focused on understanding and identifying solutions to prevent such risks during our initial pilot phase.</description>

      <description>Great Birdwatch notes follow the program&amp;rsquo;s values: They build understanding, are written in good faith, and are helpful even to those who disagree.
   &amp;ldquo;Whales aren&amp;rsquo;t real&amp;rdquo;   Here&amp;rsquo;s a Tweet making misleading claims about whales, followed by helpful and unhelpful Birdwatch notes:
Whales are not actually mammals. If Humans (land mammals) can’t drink seawater — just try it! — how can supposed sea mammals like whales stay hydrated?</description>

      <guid>https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/about/ranking-notes/</guid>
      <description>Birdwatch notes are submitted and rated by contributors. Ratings are used to determine Note Status (e.g. “Currently Rated Helpful”), which notes are displayed on each of the Birdwatch Site&amp;rsquo;s timelines, and which notes are displayed as Birdwatch Cards on the Twitter timelines.
To help people understand how Birdwatch&amp;rsquo;s ranking system works, the sections below explain how notes are assigned these statuses, ranked, and displayed.

      <description>Birdwatch aims to create a better informed world, by empowering people on Twitter to collaboratively add helpful notes to Tweets that might be misleading. Participants can identify Tweets they believe are misleading, write notes that provide context to the Tweet, and rate the quality of other participants’ notes. Through consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors, our eventual goal is that the most helpful notes will be visible directly on Tweets, available to everyone on Twitter.</description>

  Contribute to build understanding   Birdwatch seeks to provide helpful context so people can stay better informed about Tweets they see. It’s not a place for quick dunks, personal opinions, or insults. Write clear, evidence-based notes to help everyone, even skeptics, better understand a Tweet and why it might be misleading.</description>
