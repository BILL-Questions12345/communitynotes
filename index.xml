      <description>During the first phase of the pilot, Birdwatch is limited to a small test group in the US.
Our goal is to expand Birdwatch to the global Twitter community. We want anyone to be able to participate and know that the more diverse the community, the better Birdwatch will be at effectively addressing misinformation. We’ll draw on learnings from this initial test and, over time, scale safely.

      <title>Empowering the Twitter community to help with misleading information</title>
      <link>https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/posts/welcome-to-birdwatch/</link>

      <description>People come to Twitter to see what’s happening in the world. In addition to fun and entertainment, people on Twitter also want credible information that helps them stay informed. As the spread of misleading information continues to evolve, this has been harder to do.
People should be able to easily come away from Twitter feeling well-informed so we are continuing to explore a number of ways to help us scale and tackle the challenges of misleading information.</description>

      <description>We know there are many challenges involved in building a community-driven system like Birdwatch — from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn’t dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors.
Throughout our development process, we’ve conducted feedback sessions with Twitter customers and subject area experts to identify critical risks to monitor and mitigate. We will be closely focused on understanding and identifying solutions to prevent such risks during our initial pilot phase.</description>

      <description>Great Birdwatch notes follow the program&amp;rsquo;s values: They build understanding, are written in good faith, and are helpful even to those who disagree.
   &amp;ldquo;Whales aren&amp;rsquo;t real&amp;rdquo;   Here&amp;rsquo;s a Tweet making misleading claims about whales, followed by helpful and unhelpful Birdwatch notes:
Whales are not actually mammals. If Humans (land mammals) can’t drink seawater — just try it! — how can supposed sea mammals like whales stay hydrated?</description>

      <title>Note ranking</title>

      <guid>https://twitter.github.io/birdwatch/about/ranking-notes/</guid>
      <description>Birdwatch notes are submitted and rated by contributors. Ratings are used to determine Note Status (e.g. “Currently Rated Helpful”), which notes are displayed on each of the Birdwatch Site&amp;rsquo;s timelines, and which notes are displayed as Birdwatch Cards on the Twitter timelines.
To help people understand how Birdwatch&amp;rsquo;s ranking system works, the sections below explain how notes are assigned these statuses, ranked, and displayed.
   Note Status Combined Helpfulness Score  Author Helpfulness Score Preliminary Note Scoring Rater Helpfulness Score Final Note Scoring Tie breaking of reasons   Ranking Code Birdwatch Timelines  New Rated Helpful Needs Your Help Rater similarity score for Needs Your Help   Birdwatch Cards on Tweets  Cards showing a specific note Cards showing a count of notes       Note Status   All Birdwatch notes start out with the Needs More Ratings status until they receive at least 5 total ratings and at least 2 weighted ratings (the sum of the Combined Helpfulness Scores of the raters that rated the note, where Combined Helpfulness Scores are between 0 and 1).</description>

      <description>Birdwatch is a community-driven approach to address misinformation on Twitter. Participants can identify Tweets they believe are misleading, write notes that provide context to the Tweet, and rate the quality of other participants’ notes. Through consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors, our eventual goal is that community-written notes will be visible directly on Tweets, available to everyone on Twitter.
How it works In this phase, Birdwatch has three core elements: notes, ratings, and the Birdwatch site.</description>

      <description>There are two ways to find Tweets with Birdwatch notes in order to rate their quality:
Rating notes on the Birdwatch site Go to the Birdwatch Site&amp;rsquo;s Home page and choose any Tweet to see notes that participants have added to it. There are three main timelines on this page:
  Needs your help: Contains Tweets with notes where you can have the most impact when rating. This tab is only visible to pilot participants.</description>

      <description>Birdwatch aims to provide context on Tweets in a way that a broad set of people with diverse perspectives find helpful. We ask that all Birdwatch contributors agree to uphold three core values:
  Contribute to build understanding   Birdwatch seeks to provide helpful context so people can stay better informed about Tweets they see. It’s not a place for quick dunks, personal opinions, or insults. Write clear, evidence-based notes to help everyone, even skeptics, better understand a Tweet and why it might be misleading.</description>

      <description>Anyone in the US can read Birdwatch notes, but only pilot participants can add new notes to Tweets. Here&amp;rsquo;s how to add a note:
 Click or tap the ••• menu on the Tweet&amp;rsquo;s top right and then Contribute to Birdwatch.     Before starting, you’ll see a reminder about Birdwatch values — a prompt to promote helpful contributions.
  Answer the required multiple choice questions. These are designed to understand, in a structured way, why a Tweet might or might not be misleading.</description>
