      <description>We know there are many challenges involved in building a community-driven system like Birdwatch — from making it resistant to manipulation attempts to ensuring it isn’t dominated by a simple majority or biased based on its distribution of contributors.
Throughout our development process, we’ve conducted feedback sessions with Twitter customers and subject area experts to identify critical risks to monitor and mitigate. We will be closely focused on understanding and identifying solutions to prevent such risks during our initial pilot phase.</description>

      <description>Birdwatch notes are submitted and rated by contributors. Ratings are used to determine Note Status (e.g. “Currently Rated Helpful”), which notes are displayed on each of the Birdwatch Site&amp;rsquo;s timelines, and which notes are displayed as Birdwatch Cards on the Twitter timelines.
To help people understand how Birdwatch&amp;rsquo;s ranking system works, the sections below explain how notes are assigned these statuses, ranked, and displayed.

      <title>Overview</title>

      <description>Birdwatch is a community-driven approach to address misinformation on Twitter. Participants can identify Tweets they believe are misleading, write notes that provide context to the Tweet, and rate the quality of other participants’ notes. Through consensus from a broad and diverse set of contributors, our eventual goal is that community-written notes will be visible directly on Tweets, available to everyone on Twitter.
How it works In this phase, Birdwatch has three core elements: notes, ratings, and the Birdwatch site.</description>
