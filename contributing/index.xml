      <description>Examples Great Birdwatch notes follow the program&amp;rsquo;s values: They build understanding, are written in good faith, and are helpful even to those who disagree.

      <description>Values Birdwatch aims to provide context on Tweets in a way that a broad set of people with diverse perspectives find helpful. We ask that all Birdwatch contributors agree to uphold three core values:
  Contribute to build understanding   Birdwatch seeks to provide helpful context so people can stay better informed about Tweets they see.
