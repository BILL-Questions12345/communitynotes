# Request a Community Note

People on X can request a Community Note on a post they believe would benefit from one. If there are enough requests, Community Notes contributors will see an alert, and can choose to propose a note. This gives people on X who are not contributors a way to help, and lets contributors know where notes might be found helpful.

### Requesting a note

- Tap the ••• menu on a post, then tap **Request Community Note**
- To be eligible to request a note, accounts must have a **verified phone number**
- Initially, accounts can make up to 5 requests per day. The limit may increase if requests successfully result in helpful notes, or may decrease if requests are on posts that people don’t agree need a note. This helps prevent spam and keep note writers focused on posts that could use helpful notes.

### Contributors seeing requests

Contributors who have earned [Top Writer status](../contributing/top-contributors.md) will see that there are requests on a post, if there are enough requests.

During the pilot launch of note requests, requests will show on a post if: 
- The post is less than 24 hours old
- There are 5 or more requests

We expect these criteria to evolve, with the goal that requests are frequently found valuable to contributors, and not noisy. The criteria are initially simple during this pilot phase.
